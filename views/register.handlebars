        <h2>This goes out to all the people working at Ullsteinhaus:</h2>
        <p id="welcomeText">Haven't you had those moments in the last weeks where you sat there freezing and thinking: 
        well, some cookies and a warm cup of tea would be just what I need right now!<br>
        Especially in those times of Corona, where it is best not to get too close to each other. <br>
        <br>
        Well - in this building there are people working who actually know how to program drones. 
        And who are experimenting with them!<br>
        <br>
        Sign here if you think some of the programmers working and 
        learning here should spend a fair amount of their time on programming 
        those drones to deliver whatever those small wishes are that would make you smile right now...<br>
        Think about how much more amazing being in this building could be! 
        And how much fun for the students of "Spiced Academy"!</p>
